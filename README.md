### What is Pharmor?

 ![Pharmor](https://github.com/t-a-g-o/pharmor/blob/ba93865ed3764a81b0bbfb1bb32de45c4303acda/showcase.png)

Pharmor is a tool that I (tago) developed to try and automate the process of making TikTok story videos as much as I can. You know the videos with Minecraft parkour and a random reddit story being
presented, yeah this will basically automate all of that from the image overlaying, cutting the video down, and text to speech!
This is just releasing so I do plan on heavily working to improve on it and make it the best I can, and also see if it's possible to make money with the Creator Funds

## How to make a video using Pharmor
This is the quickest way to get setup with Pharmor
### Downloading Pharmor
Download the latest Pharmor compile from the releases tab and run the file.
This should automatically download any required libraries automatically for you.
### Using Pharmor
* Provide a YouTube URL, I recommend this video to be at least 1920x1080 since Pharmor crops to the middle
* Put all your images asending from 1 in the created "images" folder. (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
* Press enter



## Compile Pharmor

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
